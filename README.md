# Setroc

Yes, that is Cortes backwards. Very unique, right? Now stop looking at my code, I get self conscious.

Okay but really now; this site is built using React (with some organized and pretty cool components), React Helmet, React Router, and Tachyons for styling. Have at it if you want to figure things out.


### To run locally

1. Clone this repository
2. `npm install` to grab dependencies
3. `npm start` to watch changes live and locally


### Disclaimer

Although I provide this code publicly, it is only to be used for learning and I ask that you not copy it or anything on it directly. I worked my butt off to get this site how it is now and it's unfair to just take someone's work like that. Thanks friend.
