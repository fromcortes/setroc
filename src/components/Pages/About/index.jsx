          <p className="lh-copy">
            I‚Äôm a digital designer and illustrator that codes based in Saint Louis from Bayam√≥n, Puerto Rico. I have 5+ years of experience
            in the world of design and illustration and have built products both on my own and on a team. Currently,
            I am the design lead and a developer at <a className="fw6 link link-underlined black rainbow-hover" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://satchelhealth.com">Satchel Health</a>,
            and am the co-founder of <a className="fw6 link link-underlined black rainbow-hover" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://usequarry.com">Quarry</a>, where I build products that help people.
          </p>
          <p className="lh-copy">
            Outside of design, I write quite a bit and release an article each week (40+ weeks!). I also spend time
            learning code on my own and build projects with that knowledge for fun. As a firm believer in giving
            to others, a lot of my efforts go to building things that will help others as well as helping those in
            the design and tech industry. I stream the majority of my work on <a className="fw6 link link-underlined black rainbow-hover" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitch.tv/cortesarts">Twitch</a>,
            where others can hang out and maybe learn a few things.
          </p>
          <p className="lh-copy">
            I'm always open to chat! Whether you have a project I can help you with, a new hiring opportunity, or
            just want to say hi and ask me a question, please feel free to email me at <a className="fw6 link link-underlined black rainbow-hover" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="mailto:hi@cortes.us">hi@cortes.us</a> üì©

              I believe all work is more than just technique. Thought process is driven by a combination of knowledge, ethics, and philosophy. I think about these topics a lot and am always trying to refine and improve, here's how I currently approach my work and process.

              People are the essence of the technology industry. Without people, we would have no clear purpose in our work. I believe in helping people feel welcomed and included when it comes to my work and who I am as a person.
