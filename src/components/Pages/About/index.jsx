                Iâ€™m a 22 year old digital designer and illustrator based in Saint Louis. I picked up design
                a little later than I would have liked to. Because of this, Iâ€™ve had to push myself to learn
                about this industry and understand the power of hard work all while developing a love for
                knowledge and the possibilities of design. I learned through hours of teaching myself most of
                what I know about design and business through my own passion and interests in people I admire
                and facets of the digital design world.
