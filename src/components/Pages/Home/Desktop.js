          <p className="lh-copy">
            I‚Äôm a digital designer and illustrator that codes based in Memphis, TN from Bayam√≥n, Puerto Rico. I have 5+ years of experience
            in the world of design and illustration and have built products both on my own and on a team.
            I love working on projects that require multidisciplinary skill sets solving complex issues that make the lives of people better.
          </p>
          <p className="lh-copy">
            Outside of design, I write and release at least one article a week (50+ weeks!). I also spend time
            learning code on my own and build projects with that knowledge for fun. As a firm believer in giving
            to others, a lot of my efforts go to building things that will help others as well as helping those in
            the design and tech industry. I stream the majority of my work on <a className="fw6 link link-underlined black rainbow-hover" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitch.tv/cortesarts">Twitch</a>,
            where others can hang out and maybe learn a few things.
          </p>
          <p className="lh-copy">
            I'm always open to chat! Say hello at <a className="fw6 link link-underlined black rainbow-hover" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="mailto:hi@cortes.us">hi@cortes.us</a> üì©

            When I'm not designing or writing code you can find me trying to learn new things, playing video games, writing, learning about coffee, trying out new tech, treating my dogs like kids, catching Pok√©mon, or making music.

              I believe all work is more than just technique. Thought process is driven by a combination of knowledge, ethics, and philosophy. I think about these topics a lot and am always trying to refine and improve, here's how I currently approach my work and process.
