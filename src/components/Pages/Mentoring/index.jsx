            I'm here to help. After years of requests for a mentorship service from me and my own personal views on the value of mentoring,
            I've figured out a way that you can book 1-on-1 a 45 minute video or audio chat with me.

                Mentoring from me is a great way to ask any questions you may have about
                work approach and/or methodologies from my perspective. Through the amount
                of experience and time I've put into what I know, you will leave our
                session with insight and actionable steps for your own career. I'll also provide any
                resources and connections I can to help you improve and save you from the hours
                I've put into finding and learning them.

                I want us to both be serious about this mentorship and the value I'll
                be providing for you. Our time is important and I want to give you
                dedicated time for the questions you have. I truly believe I'll provide
                value beyond what you pay through my years of experience on both
                professional and personal design and development projects and career.

              <p className="lh-copy black-60 mb4">
                I also understand how important it is to get valuable mentorship
                in your career. I've been lucky enough to have some great mentors
                in my life and want to give you that same value as best I can. All expertise, advice,
                resources, connections, and tools I provide to you during our session took
                years of hard work for me to learn and gather. With a mentorship session,
                I happily bring these to you and openly to give you the headstart I wish I had.
